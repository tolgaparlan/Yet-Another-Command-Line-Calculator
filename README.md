A basic integer arithmetic calculator I have built with Rust for self-learning. 

Run with `cargo run`.

Starts a REPL to evaluate arithmetic expressions and produce the calculated result at the next line.

```
./simple-calculator
123+0
123
123+1324
1447
234-2
232
23-
Expected Number
23-345
-322
234/(4+23)
8
234/(233)
1
exit
```

So far only supports addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
